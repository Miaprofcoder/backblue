Module# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## Description
This is the 13th assignment or challenge for our bootcamp class. Our assignment this week is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. Youâ€™ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Installation
MySQL2, Sequelize and dotenv packages are needed to connect Express.js API to MySQL and store sensitive data.

* Use the `schema.sql` file in the `db` folder to create your database with MySQL shell commands.

* After creating the models and routes, run `npm run seed` to seed data to your database


## Usage
Given the command-line application that accepts user input, user will be prompted with a menu of option : view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, update an employee role, and delete employee.
